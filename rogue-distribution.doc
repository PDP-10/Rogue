our  names  credited  in  the  version  ("v")  command.    Please  see the file
Rogue.Policy for more details.  In addition, we would like to receive copies of
any new versions of Rogue created from our sources.  That way we can play it on
other machines, too.  If you would like,  we  can  let  you  know  of  any  new
versions, also.  Address any Mail to BUG-ROGUE@ECLC.USC.EDU.
